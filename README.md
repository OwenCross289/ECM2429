# ECM2429
Assignment for ECM2429

All packages installed using pip freeze. 
Installation:
1.	Extract the ECM2429-Assignment.zip to the desired location  
2.	Firstly a virtual environment will need to be created for the application. To do this open a windows command line terminal and type ’{location to python install} -m venv {location of assignment folder}’ for me this was ‘C:\Python39\python -m venv C:\Users\User\Desktop\Assignemnt\ECM2429’. 
3.	Launch the venv by navigating to the scripts folder and run the ‘Activate.bat’ file for windows. I did this by dragging the script to a cmd terminal and pressing enter. Once in this terminal cd to the assignment folder for me this was ‘cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\Assignemnt\ECM2429’.
4.	In the same terminal run the command ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ to install all of the application requirements.
5.	Finally, to run the application, navigate to the src folder (ECM2429-Assignment\src) and drag the MainViewModel.py to the cmd window running the venv.
6.	As an optional last step to get API access for the application, in a sepereate terminal run the API.py file found at the root of the ECM2429-assignment folder (I recommend dragging and dropping this into a terminal)
